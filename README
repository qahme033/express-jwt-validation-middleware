Simple middleware function for express route jwt validations.

Simple to use.

    const jwt = require('express_jwt_validation_middleware');

    app.use(jwt);

Using this middleware means all requests will need to have a cookie named 'jwt'. 

If the jwt was signed with the private key corresponding to the public key in your project root then the middleware stack continues.

If not an error will be thrown and it is your applications job to handle it.
